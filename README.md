# rive.rip

A better alternative to preview `.riv` files, because [the official previewer](https://rive.app/preview/) is not good enough.

## Features
1. Play Individual Animations (like the official previewer)
2. Play with State Machines (new feature)

## Progress
- [x] Install NextJS and Shadcn
- [ ] Create simple UI for uploading `.riv` file
- [ ] Printing out the content of the `.riv` file
