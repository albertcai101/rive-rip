# rive.rip

A better alternative to preview `.riv` files, because [the official previewer](https://rive.app/preview/) is not good enough.
Intended use is for teams, where developers and animators are different people.
The common problem is that developers can't preview the state machine without Rive itself or the `.rev` file.

## Features
1. Play Individual Animations (like the official previewer)
2. Play with State Machines (new feature)

## Progress
- [x] Install NextJS and Shadcn
- [ ] Create simple UI for uploading `.riv` file
- [ ] Printing out the content of the `.riv` file
